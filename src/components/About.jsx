      <h2>What is our goal?</h2>
      <p>Global food waste is a growing problem all across the world. We were alarmed by the fact that about $1.9 billion worth of food was wasted in 2021 and was projected to grow further along the years.<br></br>We designed this app to reduce food waste by helping people keep track of their food items. Waste Not will notify you when your food is about to go bad and also recommend you some recipes according to your pantry items.
